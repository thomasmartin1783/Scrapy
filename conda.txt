Viewing a list of available Python versions

===========================================


Updating or upgrading Python
Use the terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps.

If you are in an environment with Python version 3.4.2, the following command updates Python to the latest version in the 3.4 branch:

conda update python

===========================================

The following command upgrades Python to another branch---3.8---by installing that version of Python. It is not recommended, rather it is preferable to create a new environment. The resolver has to work very hard to determine exactly which packages to upgrade. But it is possible, and the command is:

conda install python=3.8
